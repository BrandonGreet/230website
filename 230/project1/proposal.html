			<p>
				Hares like yourself find farmland to be a perfect home, but yours has become decrepit this past fall, and now you must find a 
				new home. Caught in the cold snow of a harsh wilderness, use everything you can to your advantage as you avoid predators and 
				find a new home.

			<h2>Style</h2>
			<p>
				If possible, I would style this game should reflect old children’s fable books, but I cannot say I’m any sort of artist.

			<h2>Gameplay and Mechanics</h2>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					The main mechanics of this game are as follows: Classic stealth mechanics: Enemies have a cone of sight, which can be 
					obstructed by physical objects the player can hide behind. Possibly a noise system and “make noise” control can be 
					implemented. The hare is colored white, and so can reasonably hide in snow mounds where they are found.
				</li>
				<li>
					The controls: WASD/arrows for movement, space bar for leaping forward, (possibly) a button for making noise, and shift for 
					hiding in snow mounds.
				</li>
				<li>
					The player is taught basic controls via a pop-up, consequences of failing to hide from predators can be shown in the 
					background, denoting what the objective.
				</li>
				<li>
					The player will need to learn how to hide from enemies, manipulate the environment to their advantage, and find safe passage 
					to their objective without any help directly given.
				</li>
