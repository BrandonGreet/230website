# Game Treatment

## The Big Picture
Inspired by early Metal Gear installments, players find themselves avoiding predators like vicious wolves and terrifying owls on a journey to safety.

## Genre
A top-down stealth/puzzle game

## Platform
Web application (run in browser)

## Story
Hares like yourself find farmland to be a perfect home, but yours has become decrepit this past fall, and now you must find a new home. Caught in the cold snow of a harsh wilderness, use everything you can to your advantage as you avoid predators and find a new home.

## Style
If possible, this game should reflect children’s novellas I used to read, but I cannot say I’m any sort of artist.

## Gameplay and Mechanics
1. The main mechanics of this game are as follows: Classic stealth mechanics: Enemies have a cone of sight, which can be obstructed by physical objects the player can hide behind. Possibly a noise system and “make noise” control can be implemented. The hare is colored white, and so can reasonably hide in snow mounds where they are found.

2. The controls: WASD/arrows for movement, space bar for leaping forward, (possibly) a button for making noise, and shift for hiding in snow mounds.

3. The player is taught basic controls via a pop-up, consequences of failing to hide from predators can be shown in the background, denoting what the objective.

4. The player will need to learn how to hide from enemies, manipulate the environment to their advantage, and find safe passage to their objective without any help directly given.
