		<ol>
			<li>Proposal changed for time constraints. Notes made for development</li>
			<li>First prototype complete. No final objective but mechanics (while buggy) are present. "gameSetup();levelSetup();" must be input to console to run game.</li>
			<li>Carrots added. There is now an objective that triggers levelSetup().</li>
			<li>Movement and bounds detection added. Owls added, will move toward player if player gets too close.</li>
			<li>Sprites created and added to game, boundary circles tweaked with.</li>
			<li>Scenes fleshed out with rich text and options.</li>
			<li>Overhaul of code for readability/following DRY standard.</li>
			<li>Hare and owls now face where they're moving, this is a miracle.</li>
			<li>Logical error sending hare into infinity is resolved. Slight constraint on movement capability as a result.</li>
			<li>Clearing scene bugs fixed, garbage objects now cleared up.</li>
			<li>Level design implemented. NOTE: Implementing further levels is very easy and only takes a couple minutes to do.</li>
			<li>Final submission complete and polished. POSTMORTEM: I would have added more features if I had time, for instance I wanted to include stumps that would restrict player movement and wolves that would move along set paths. On the bright side, I am very happy with my concept implementation. I feel the final product is well polished and expandable in a way taht gives it potential.</li>
