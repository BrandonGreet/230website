				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				<p>This page documents the development of "Help! I'm Bored!"</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>API Chosen</h3>
				<p>
					Bored API is a fairly straight-forward service. A user submits an http request and the api responds with an activity represented by 
					a JSON object. Each object contains several values which can be used to sort the possible responses. No authentication required.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Connecting to Bored API</h3>
				<p>
					In order to successfully connect with Bored API, a proxy was set up using Heroku App. This is done by prepending the API request url 
					with the proxy service. This has caused unreliable loading times when requesting a new activity from Bored API.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Functional api search</h3>
				<p>You can now (clunk-ily) send a request to Bored API and get a request that is displayed on the website.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Email form not functional</h3>
				<p>The form for sending an email reminder is there but it has no functionality. As it turns out JS doesn't have that capability on its own</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Local storage set up for Bored API search</h3>
				<p>All values for the api search are stored in localStorage and are displayed once a user revists the site</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Email reminder abandoned</h3>
				<p>Another functionality will need to be implemented.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Color scheme and app design completed</h3>
				<p>App is basically done.</p>
			</li>
