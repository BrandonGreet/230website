				Hello! My name is Brandon Greet. I am of course a second year Game Design student at <em>University of Rochester<em>. I hope 
				to make my websites look better and be more interactive in this class. Specifically, I want to learn JS libraries like pixiJS 
				that would create fluid web apps. One day I hope to be leading a dev team, creating AAA titles, but now I'm exploring 
				everything RIT has to offer me. When I graduate, I want to be looking forward to an exciting job in the industry. Now, as for 
				two of my interests, I love music, especially rock, and playing my guitar of course.
